The artifact chosen for the database is a MySQL code that produces a database called school. 
It will incorporate the MongoDB interface with HTML/Javascript that will build upon the current program. 
The reason for selecting the MySQL database structure to add to my ePortfolio is that MySQL is easy to manage and understandable when tables within the database are constructed. 
The specific skills showcased when creating the database are typing commands that will develop a specific table desired. 
An example of this code is a simple command line, “CREATE TABLE.” It will allow the user to input columns, data types, and notes. 
The improvement of this artifact achieves the ability to utilize other commands to input people to the school table that would attach names to the columns. 
The course objectives planned to meet with the enhancement shows that progress was made. 
At this point, there will not be any more updates to the outcome-coverage plans. 
The MySQL database established displays all the needed desired requirements to develop the table school.
  The reflection of this active process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact includes the direct line of code to carefully develop the successful outcome desired to construct a table. 
Prime examples of this code are, CREATE DATABASE school and USE school. 
These simple command lines typically allow the content creation of the table school and the proper use of the school to input information. 
Some key things efficiently absorb during the process of development accurately represent the creation of a database, how to input columns, and display the specific items included to the table. 
The biggest challenge during this process was carefully choosing the correct IDE. 
At this key point, the MySQL file will only show the command line CREATE DATABASE school. 
The rest of the executable file is maintained in the SQL server object explorer.
