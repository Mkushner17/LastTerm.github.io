The artifact chosen for Software Design and Engineering is a C++ code that takes a salary to calculate a tax rate and tax to pay. This code is taken from chapter 12, section 17 inside zyBooks (2015). The program can run a zero annual salary input and end the program when a user enters a negative number for their annual salary. The reason for choosing this artifact to work on was that it is useful to help companies and people find a tax rate for their salary from different ranges. The Salary program also can increase the process when determining a tax rate. Specific components of the artifact chosen showcase my skills by developing the code with strings that instruct a user prompt and executing the program to perform the job to calculate a tax to pay. At this point in regarding to meet the course objectives planned, updates will not be needed since the code currently runs as it should. The outcome-coverage plan will show that the while condition does not fail in the console. To enhance the code further would show that the syntax errors are fixed and end the inner while loop appropriately.	
Reflecting on this process of enhancing and/or modifying artifact I learned while referring to zyBooks, creating the program code was to successfully develop an outcome code that included a function for the input of the integer. This would display an altered code to allow a zero annual salary and to end when a user enters a negative number. The challenges while creating the code was to properly initialize the loop, “while” first in the program, then to the corresponding functions to print the annual salary.
