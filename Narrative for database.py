Artifact chosen for algorithm and data structure is a Python code that will produce a sum of an array. The creation of code to develop an array of sums was borrowed from (geeksforgeeks.org, 2020) The reason for this decision in choosing this code is that it demonstrates an array to sort an algorithm with sums that can be adjusted with different numbers to reflect this. The submission of the Python code demonstrates multiple sets of doing the task. When choosing this program shows that it is a simple artifact that easily demonstrates how an algorithm and data structure occurs. The specific components of the artifact showcase my skills in understanding the ability to recognize arrays in code and to continue learning to add more components. Some different components to the code submitted would be making the code shorter to do the same task. This improvement to the code would be an inbuilt function that would add all elements in a list that would set tuples and return the value of the sum. 
At this time when meeting the course objectives planned to meet with this enhancement show that statically assigning list value to a list.
My enhancement will query the user for individual numeric values. 
This would be done by creating the list that will process it the number of times the user requests for the different data sets. 
  The reflection of this process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact included a use case to perform a sum of an array. 
The learning process from working with this artifact details that commenting on each line contributes to understanding what the code does to get the sum of an array. 
Changing input values to the list allows a different calculation of the array. 
The biggest challenge faced was using the right IDE to develop the code. Having different IDEâ€™s to perform tasks and keeping all files with each IDE made it simpler to maintain. In closing, the submission of the Python code is a short file to demonstrate algorithm and data structures of the sum of an array.
