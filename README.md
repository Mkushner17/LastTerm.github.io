Professional Self-Assessment:
	During my journey through the Computer Science program and completing coursework has taken me to new heights. 
This showcased my strengths by completing the coursework throughout the program to include knowledge gained to develop and incorporate new techniques.
Examples that have been learned are collaborative strategies for software projects, software development with agile methodologies, and gaining a security mindset. 
The collaborative strategies for software projects included involvement with colleagues by pushing a code and committing it for review or enhancement from fellow collaborators.
During the software development of projects, agile was incorporated with a team of colleagues in a Scrum meeting. 
This included virtual meetings that would take place every morning to discuss issues during the programâ€™s lifecycle. 
Developing secure code and having a security mindset displays a technique that guard against security vulnerabilities.
  In summary, the artifacts chosen fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole by displaying my abilities that demonstrates how my thought process included enhancements to each artifact. 
Developing the chosen artifacts shows how it started and how it ended to develop sound code with enhancements to improve the code. 
The following technical artifacts will show that a comprehensive strategy was employed to demonstrate my talents and abilities. 
Each section will describe the artifact, why it was chosen, and a reflection on the process of enhancing each artifact.
